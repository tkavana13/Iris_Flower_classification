# Iris_Flower_classification
This project is about getting familiar with machine learning classification problem

## Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three species of Iris flowers.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Model and evaluation results.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.

Programming Languages Used
   Python

Libraries Used:
Machine Learning and Data Processing
   1. pandas
   2. scikit-learn
   3. joblib

Data Visualization
   1. matplotlib
   2. seaborn


Key Steps in the Workflow :

 1.Data Loading: Reading data from a CSV file.
 2.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
 3.Model Training: Utilizing a machine learning model to classify the data.
 4.Model Evaluation: Checking the accuracy of the model.
 5.Visualization: Creating plots to visualize features and feature importances.

 Here is the output of this project  :

  It is the accuracy of the trained data model
