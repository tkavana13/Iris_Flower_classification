# Iris_Flower_classification
This project is about getting familiar with machine learning classification problem

## Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three species of Iris flowers.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Model and evaluation results.

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the scripts in the `src/` directory to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model.
